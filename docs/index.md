# \<SOAP/> dodger

Friends don't let friends use \<SOAP/>.

I don't mean "soap", of course, that would be ridiculous. No, I mean
the "Simple Object Access Protocol", an outdated method for implementing
web services.

If you'd like the world to know that you're a \<SOAP/> dodger, then
please [buy a t-shirt](https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/davorg/soap?q=T535749).
