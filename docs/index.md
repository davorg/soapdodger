# \<SOAP/> dodger

Friends don't let friends use \<SOAP/>.

I don't mean "[soap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap)", of course, that
would be ridiculous (and a little disgusting). No, I mean the
"[Simple Object Access Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)",
an outdated and over-complicated method for implementing web services.

If you'd like the world to know that you're a \<SOAP/> dodger, then
please [buy a t-shirt](https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/davorg/soap?q=T535749).
